## Features

- Displays a bar chart with animated data points.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Interactive tooltip for data points.

## How it Works

The Interactive Data Visualization web application is built using HTML, CSS, Chart.js, and Anime.js. Here's how it works:

### HTML Structure

- The HTML structure defines a `canvas` element with the ID `myChart`, which serves as the container for the bar chart.

### CSS Styling

- CSS styles are applied to create a responsive and visually appealing chart container. The container has a maximum width of 600px and is centered horizontally.

### JavaScript Functionality

- Chart.js is used to create the bar chart. Sample data for the chart is provided in the JavaScript code.
- Anime.js is used to apply smooth animations to the data points. The animations alternate between growing and shrinking the data points.
- The Chart.js options include a responsive design and an interactive tooltip that displays the value of each data point when hovered.
